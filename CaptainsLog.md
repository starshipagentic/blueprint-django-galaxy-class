Built LIFTOFF.py that procedurally updates MISSION.md via aider. 

TODO:
- Need to have IGNITION.py build the project md files
- Then build out LIFTOFF to fill out project md files
- Clean up LIFTOFF to work on more than just mac
- What needs to be downloaded in venv from LIFTOFF.py in the IGNITION.py

Questions to investigate:
1. Is running aider procedurally updating aider chat history?
2. How do I add context to aider when called at procedural level?
3. Clean up LIFTOFF to work on more than just mac
4. What needs to be downloaded in venv from LIFTOFF.py in the IGNITION.py?
