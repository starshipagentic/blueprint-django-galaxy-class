## Notes for Implementation

1. Dependency Graph Tips:
   - Start with core system components
   - Add features in order of dependency
   - Include all external integrations
   - Mark optional dependencies clearly

2. Project Plan Tips:
   - Break sprints by logical components
   - Group related features together
   - Define clear integration points
   - Include testing at each stage

3. Build Order Tips:
   - Start with core infrastructure
   - Build features in dependency order
   - Plan for integration testing
   - Include deployment considerations

4. Verification Tips:
   - Review dependencies regularly
   - Test integration points early
   - Validate build order feasibility
   - Document assumptions clearly
